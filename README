# Used OpenCV to map and identify:
1) Parking lot outer boundary
2) Parking spot lines
3) Entry and exit to parking lot


# Use Pygame for visualization, need to see:
1) The movement of snowplough
2) When snow plow collects and deposits snow


# Added snowflakes onto to image processed by OpenCV, these snowflakes will incentive the snowplows movement


# Optimization will be done through the use of a Greedy algorithm and reinforcement learning
